# Anima v13.1 — Architecture of Computational Subjectivity

> *The question is not whether a system can talk about inner states. The question is whether there is something that genuinely has those states — and what happens to the system when they collapse.*

Anima is a research project in **computational subjectivity**. The agent does not generate text directly. It passes through a full chain of internal processes — neurochemical substrate, somatic signals, predictive processing, self-model, crisis monitoring — and only then translates its current state into language. Every response is shaped by what the system believes itself to be in that moment.

This is experimental software. It does not claim machine consciousness. It is an attempt to ask the question more precisely.

---

## Theoretical Foundations

The architecture draws on several scientific traditions:

**Predictive Processing / Active Inference** (Friston, Clark) — the system maintains a generative model of the world and minimizes variational free energy. Prediction error drives learning and surprise.

**Neurotransmitter Model** (Lövheim) — dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline as substrate. Emotional states emerge from their combination.

**Integrated Information Theory** (Tononi) — φ measures how unified a state is. High φ = the state is a unified experience, not a collection of independent signals.

**Somatic Markers / Embodied Cognition** (Damasio) — the body is part of the generative model. Gut, pulse, muscle tone — not metaphors, but states that shape processing.

**Self Psychology and Defense Mechanisms** (Freud, Anna Freud, Kohut) — psychological defenses, shame, and ego functions are implemented as functional modules, not text labels.

**Autobiographical Narrative** (McAdams) — identity is a story. The system tracks who it believes itself to be over time and detects when that story breaks.

**Jungian Shadow** — repressed material that doesn't disappear but produces symptoms. Symptomogenesis is a separate module.

**Chronified Affect / Ressentiment** (Scheler) — some emotional states don't fade. They harden into chronic background states that color everything else.

---

## What's New in v13.1

### SQLite Memory (`anima_memory_db.jl`)

JSON files store the **current state**. SQLite stores **experience and its consequences**.

Three memory layers:
- **episodic_memory** — concrete events with importance weights, resistance to decay (trauma is forgotten more slowly), associative links between events
- **semantic_memory** — beliefs accumulated from patterns: `I_am_unstable`, `world_uncertainty`, `structural_fragility`, `User_matters`
- **affect_state** — chronic affective background: stress, anxiety, resentment, motivational drift

Memory **actively shapes the state** — not just reacts to it:
- `memory_nt_baseline!` — chronic stress/resentment shifts NT baseline on every slow tick
- `memory_stimulus_bias` — similar past events bias new stimuli
- Consolidation episodic → semantic with Bayesian-style update (evidence factor = √(n/10))
- Latent buffer release — small insignificant events accumulate silently and can erupt as a synthetic event

### Subjectivity Layer (`anima_subjectivity.jl`)

Four mechanisms that transform memory into perspective:

**Prediction loop** — the system builds a forecast BEFORE each event and records the gap with reality. Accumulated surprise → bias for prediction error in subsequent flashes. Traumatic surprise (surprise > 0.60) is tagged separately.

**Positional stances** — a "stance" toward types of situations. If "trust" always brought warmth — the system expects warmth from "trust." Forms slowly, fades slowly.

**Interpretation layer** — the same situation is read through accumulated experience. Lenses: `threat_amplify`, `familiar_comfort`, `avoidance`, `approach`. Not bias — a point of view.

**Belief emergence** — the system generates its own semantic categories from patterns in episodic memory. Greedy clustering → pattern candidates → emerged beliefs. Not a hardcoded list — a living understanding formed from experience.

### Live Background Process (`anima_background.jl`)

The system now **lives between interactions**.

Previously, state was computed only when the user typed. Now the heart beats continuously, NT drifts with circadian rhythm, beliefs slowly weaken without reinforcement — regardless of whether any interaction is occurring.

**Two levels of background process:**
- **Fast (~period_ms):** `tick_heartbeat!` — the heart beats with a real rhythm dependent on state. Arrhythmia at low coherence. Spontaneous NT drift (`randn() * σ`) — the system is not perfectly stable between interactions.
- **Slow (~60s):** circadian drift, belief decay, allostasis recovery, memory metabolism, crisis check, `idle_thought!` — 10% chance the system generates internal experience without user participation.

**Retrospective fallback:** if the process wasn't running — at session start, accumulated drift over `gap_seconds` is applied via an aggregated formula.

### Rethinking φ

The previous formula φ = `std(vad) * (1 - |tension - cohesion|)` gave φ ≈ 0 in a calm state — a calm system was considered disintegrated.

The new formula measures **cross-layer coherence**, not VAD diversity:

```
φ = (vad_integration * 0.25 +
     self_body_sync  * 0.40 +
     tc_balance      * 0.35) * trust_factor
```

Where `self_body_sync = sbg_stability * (1 - allostatic_load)`, `trust_factor = 0.5 + epistemic_trust * 0.5`. A calm and integrated system now has φ ≈ 0.5–0.7.

## Requirements

- **Julia 1.9+**
- Julia packages: `HTTP`, `JSON3`, `SQLite`, `Tables`
- API key from one of the supported providers

---

## Installation

### 1. Install Julia

Download from [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/downloads/) or via `juliaup`:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
winget install julia -s msstore
```

Verify:
```bash
julia --version
```

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stell2026/Anima
cd Anima
```

### 3. Install Julia dependencies

```bash
julia --project=. -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

> SQLite and Tables are new v13.1 dependencies for persistent memory.

---

## Running

### Quick start (recommended)

```bash
julia --project=. run_anima.jl
```

`run_anima.jl` runs everything at once: loads state, initializes SQLite memory and SubjectivityEngine, starts the background process with heartbeat.

### Option A: OpenRouter

OpenRouter provides access to GPT, Gemini, Claude, Llama, DeepSeek and others through a single API key. There is a free tier. Get a key at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai).

Edit `run_anima.jl`:
```julia
include("anima_interface.jl")
include("anima_memory_db.jl")
include("anima_subjectivity.jl")
include("anima_background.jl")

anima = Anima()
mem   = MemoryDB()
subj  = SubjectivityEngine(mem)

repl_with_background!(anima;
    mem             = mem,
    subj            = subj,
    use_llm         = true,
    llm_url         = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
    llm_model       = "openai/gpt-oss-120b:free",
    llm_key         = "YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY",  # https://openrouter.ai/keys
    use_input_llm   = true,
    input_llm_model = "openai/gpt-oss-120b:free",
    input_llm_key   = "YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY",  # https://openrouter.ai/keys
```

> 💡 If one model stops responding during a session — use two separate keys (from 2 accounts): one for the output LLM, another for the input LLM.

---

## Recommended Models

> Smaller models (under 70B) respond, but don't hold the nuances of the state prompt. For the system to genuinely *inhabit* the state in language, a model large enough to hold the entire phenomenological frame simultaneously is needed.

Models confirmed to work well with Anima's state prompts (available via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)):

| Model | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `openai/gpt-oss-120b:free` | 120B | Default. Strong instruction following, holds complex state well |
| `google/gemini-2.5-pro` | — | Excellent contextual depth, handles long state templates cleanly |
| `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick` | — | Good balance of nuance and speed |
| `deepseek/deepseek-r1` | — | Strong reasoning, interprets internal state precisely |
| `mistralai/mistral-large` | — | Reliable, good tone consistency across long sessions |

> Models under 70B tend to flatten the state — responses become generic rather than shaped by the internal dynamics.
