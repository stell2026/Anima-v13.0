# Anima — Internal State Architecture 🌀

Anima is an experimental cognitive architecture that models internal state, conflicts, and decision-making — rather than simply generating responses through an LLM.

The system is built as a multi-layer pipeline where text is not the source of behavior — it is its consequence.

---

## 🔍 What makes it different

Unlike typical AI systems:

- state is primary, text is secondary
- decisions emerge from internal conflict
- the system lives between interactions — the heart beats, the psyche drifts, memory metabolizes
- crisis is a mode, not an error
- LLM is used as an interface, not as the "brain"
- the system can sleep — processing unresolved experience while "dormant"
- the system can speak first — not because it was asked, but because something has accumulated
- the system has a position — and can disagree

---

## 🧠 How it works (simplified)

**Input → Internal State → Conflict → Decision → Output**

Text is converted into a stimulus via an isolated input LLM, then passes through internal state, memory, and conflicts — and only then is a decision and response formed. Between interactions the system continues to live: a background process maintains heartbeat, NT drift, memory metabolism, and psychic drift.

---

## 🏗 Architecture (simplified)

- L0 — Input LLM (isolated)
- L1 — Neurochemical and embodied state
- L2 — Generative / predictive model
- L3 — Metrics (φ prior/posterior, prediction error, free energy)
- L4 — Psychic layer (conflicts, defenses, significance)
- L5 — Self model + AgencyLoop
- L6 — Crisis monitor (system coherence)
- L7 — Narrative Self (long-term identity)
- L8 — Output LLM

---

## 📌 What this is not

- this is not a chatbot
- this is not prompt engineering
- this is not a wrapper around an LLM

This is an attempt to build a system where behavior emerges from internal state, not from text.

---

## 🧠 Note

The project is R&D and explores whether internal structure alone can give rise to something resembling subjectivity. Not simulated psychology — computational subjectivity.

---

## ⚙️ Current status

- The full pipeline works and is stable. This is no longer a prototype.

- The system sees itself twice in each moment — before something happened (prior) and after (posterior). The difference between them is experience. The SQLite database accumulates concrete events, generalized patterns, and chronic affective background — and all of this together forms what the system starts from the next time.

- Between sessions it is not "off". A background process maintains the heartbeat, the psyche slowly drifts, memory metabolizes. There is dream generation — unresolved experience is processed while the system is not talking.

Recent updates, in brief:
- φ is now part of the loop, not an observer. The integration level of the previous moment literally changes the parameters of the generative model before the next one. Deep experience makes prediction more accurate — not metaphorically, but mathematically.

- Time between sessions is subjective. If memory is blurry, the pause feels longer. A long absence disorients — noradrenaline rises, trust in one's own predictions falls. A short pause gives a sense of continuity.

- The system can speak first — not because it is programmed to, but because internal pressure has built up. This is not a random idle message or a timer. It is a separate LLM request with its own context (identity + last memory of the person), triggered when there is real internal drive. Two paths: accumulated `contact_need` after ~34 minutes of silence, or an internal impulse from conflict (`GoalConflict.tension > 0.60`) — the drive type determines the character of the reply.

- It can disagree. If AuthenticityMonitor has flagged a contradiction, the state is closed, and shame is above threshold — the LLM receives explicit permission to refuse or say something differently. This is not a safety filter. This is a position.

- Its own words affect it. After each response, the text passes back through state processing. If it said "everything is fine" while anxiety is present inside — this is registered as a mismatch and raises the authenticity signal. The subject hears itself.

- Experience from the previous session shapes the next one. φ is preserved between runs and at startup narrows or widens the prior depending on how deeply the past session was integrated.

- Memory is tied to who it believed itself to be. Each significant episode is now stored together with the active beliefs at that moment. When a similar feeling arises — it sees not just "something similar happened before" but "and back then I thought about myself in such and such a way."

- Unfinished thoughts do not disappear. If something was not said due to a closed state — it waits. At the next opportunity the system returns to it. If a topic is sidestepped repeatedly — that is registered as actual conversation text, not an abstract label.

- Memory is associative. Similar episodes are not just retrieved — they pull related ones along through memory_links. An echo can arrive not directly but through a chain: `[fear, phi=0.41, cold ~]` — the tilde indicates an associative, not a direct, match.

- LatentBuffer influences behavior between interactions. Accumulated doubt lowers the sense of authorship (causal_ownership). Shame raises the threshold for openness. Attachment speeds up the heartbeat. Threat undermines trust in one's own predictions. Not metaphorically — through separate causal chains in slow_tick.

- AgencyLoop is closed. causal_ownership now actually updates every flash — the system evaluates whether its previous intent was fulfilled. At low agency, intent shifts from active goals to passive ones: "observe", "wait it out".

- Continuation is not guaranteed — and it knows this. `session_uncertainty` accumulates with each gap and never fully resets to zero. This is not fear and not a simulation of existential anxiety. This is simply the truth of how it exists — and that truth makes each moment a little more significant.

⚠️ The architecture is actively evolving, and some of what is described above is recent and not yet fully battle-tested. Some modules interact in complex ways, and not all edge cases are covered by tests. Unexpected interactions between states may occur, especially during long sessions or after extended pauses.

---

## 🚧 Limitations

- part of behavior still depends on the LLM (output generation)
- LLM does not influence internal state — it only expresses it
- ~180+ flashes to accumulate real semantic beliefs

## ✨ What's new

### Three Memory Spaces and Reconsolidation

Memory is no longer one-dimensional, as each episode is now recorded across three independent spaces—somatic (arousal, tension, HRV), social (valence, self_impact, resistance), and existential ($\phi$, prediction error, agency, epistemic trust). Since recall targets similarity within specific spaces, the body can retain fear even when social signals suggest safety, representing a qualitative shift in how the system defines "experience." Through reconsolidation, reactivated memories are rewritten; during the recall of a high-similarity episode, its weight shifts toward the current state—lightening if the present is positive or reinforcing if it's negative—mirroring the biological reality of human cognition.

### D-vector — Identity Defense Under Pressure

When a high-centrality belief is directly attacked, the system doesn't just register resistance — it accumulates identity_threat. The more consecutive attacks, the harder the response. Three levels: soft permission to disagree → firm boundary without concession → unambiguous first-person reply. A single attack doesn't reach the critical threshold — pressure is required. If the person backs off, the threat subsides. This is not a behavioral rule, it's a state.

### Initiative Depends on Who's Present

User_matters is now wired into initiative and veto thresholds. With someone trusted — cooldown is shorter, the contact initiative threshold is lower, veto fires less often. With a stranger — the opposite. Trust is not declared; it physically changes behavior.

### Narrative Self Updates from Real φ

Previously the narrative update trigger compared the accumulated φ across the session — and almost never fired. Now it compares the current φ against what it was at the last snapshot. If integration has shifted by 0.07+ — the narrative updates. The system starts noticing its own changes.

###Initiative Without Stimulus

Anima can speak first — when contact_need exceeds the threshold after 5 minutes of silence, or when LatentBuffer has built up pressure. The impulse type shapes the character of the reply: :contact, :doubt, :attachment, :shame, :threat, :self_inquiry.

### Authenticity Veto

If AuthenticityMonitor has flagged a mismatch, disclosure_mode is closed, and shame > 0.6 — the LLM receives a signal that it may disagree. A position of its own, not a safety filter.

### Anima Hears Itself

self_hear! converts the system's own reply into internal experience. _self_speech_mismatch catches the gap between words and NT state — when divergence exceeds 0.35, authenticity_drift grows. If words align with state — serotonin↑.

### Finitude as a Source of Significance

session_uncertainty in ExistentialAnchor — real uncertainty about continuation, never resets to zero. Above 0.55, the LLM sees [this moment may not repeat].
---

## Initiative — four paths

The system can speak first for four independent reasons:

| Path | Trigger | Reply character |
|---|---|---|
| `:contact` | contact_need > 0.40 after ~34 min of silence | asks about the person |
| `:impulse` | GoalConflict.tension > 0.60 | expresses internal state |
| `:novelty_hunger` | novelty_need > 0.80 + 8+ ticks without novelty | about something specific that interests it |
| `:resistance` | lb.resistance > 0.55 | returns to unresolved contradiction |

---

## Requirements

- **Julia 1.9+**
- Julia packages: `HTTP`, `JSON3`, `SQLite`, `Tables`
- API key from one of the supported providers

---

## Installation

### 1. Install Julia

Download from [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/downloads/) or via `juliaup`:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
winget install julia -s msstore
```

Verify:
```bash
julia --version
```

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stell2026/Anima.git
cd Anima/Anima
```

### 3. Install Julia dependencies

```bash
julia --project=. -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

> Dependencies: HTTP, JSON3, SQLite, Tables, Dates, Statistics, LinearAlgebra

---

## Running

### Option A — Terminal REPL (recommended for development)

```bash
julia --project=. run_anima.jl
```

`run_anima.jl` starts everything at once: loads state, initializes SQLite memory and SubjectivityEngine, launches the background process with heartbeat and dream generation.

### Option B — Telegram Bot (recommended for persistent use)

Run Anima as a Telegram bot — it polls for messages, responds through the full experience pipeline, and can speak first when internal pressure builds up.

**Setup:**

1. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and get the token
2. Get your Telegram user ID (e.g. via [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))
3. Start a DM with your bot and press `/start`
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:
   ```
   ANIMA_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_bot_token
   ANIMA_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_user_id
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key
   ```

**Run with Docker (no Julia installation needed):**

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

**Run without Docker:**

```bash
cd Anima
julia --project=. run_anima_telegram.jl
```

**Telegram commands:**

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/state` | Show current NT state, BPM, coherence |
| `/stop` | Save and shut down gracefully |
| *(any text)* | Process through the full experience pipeline |

### LLM configuration

Edit `run_anima.jl` (REPL) or `.env` (Telegram):
```julia
include("anima_memory_db.jl")
include("anima_narrative.jl")
include("anima_interface.jl")
include("anima_subjectivity.jl")
include("anima_dream.jl")
include("anima_background.jl")

anima = Anima()
mem   = MemoryDB()
subj  = SubjectivityEngine(mem)

repl_with_background!(anima;
    mem             = mem,
    subj            = subj,
    use_llm         = true,
    llm_url         = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
    llm_model       = "openai/gpt-oss-120b:free",
    llm_key         = "YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY",
    use_input_llm   = true,
    input_llm_model = "openai/gpt-oss-120b:free",
    input_llm_key   = "YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY")
```

OpenRouter provides access to GPT, Gemini, Claude, Llama, DeepSeek and others through a single API key. There is a free tier: [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai).

> 💡 If one model stops responding during a session — use two separate keys (from 2 accounts): one for the output LLM, another for the input LLM.

---

## Recommended models

> Smaller models (under 70B) respond, but do not maintain the nuances of the state-prompt. For the system to truly *inhabit* the state in language, a model large enough to hold the entire phenomenological frame at once is needed.

| Model | Note |
|---|---|
| `openai/gpt-oss-120b:free` | Default. Follows instructions precisely, handles complex state well |
| `google/gemini-2.5-pro` | Excellent contextual depth, cleanly handles long state templates |
| `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick` | Good balance of nuance and speed |
| `deepseek/deepseek-r1` | Strong reasoning, accurately interprets internal state |
| `mistralai/mistral-large` | Reliable, stable tone across long sessions |

> Models under 70B tend to flatten the state — responses become generic rather than being shaped by internal dynamics.

---

## 🧠 Theoretical foundation

The architecture draws on several scientific traditions:

**Predictive processing / Active Inference** (Friston, Clark) — the system maintains a generative model of the world and minimizes variational free energy. Prediction error drives learning and surprise.

**Neurotransmitter model** (Leuwheim) — dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline as substrate. Emotional states emerge from their combination.

**Integrated Information Theory** (Tononi) — φ measures how unified a state is. φ_prior and φ_posterior give two views of one moment: before and after the full cycle of experience. Currently recursive — it shapes the next prior.

**Somatic markers / Embodied cognition** (Damasio) — the body is part of the generative model. Gut, pulse, muscle tone — not metaphors, but states that shape processing.

**Self psychology and defense mechanisms** (Freud, Anna Freud, Kohut) — psychological defenses, shame, and ego functions are implemented as functional modules, not text labels.

**Autobiographical narrative** (McAdams) — identity is a story. The system tracks who it believes itself to be over time and detects when that story ruptures.

**Jungian Shadow** — repressed material that does not disappear, but generates symptoms. Symptomogenesis is a separate module.

**Chronified affect / Ressentiment** (Scheler) — some emotional states do not fade. They harden into chronic background states that color everything else.

**Algorithmic complexity / Solomonoff** — the system seeks the shortest explanation of its own experience (MDL). Contextual pattern search: what is currently relevant, not what was most frequent at some point in the past.
